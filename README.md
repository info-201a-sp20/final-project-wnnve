# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

Overview:
Unemployment has been at an all time high because of the coronavirus; however, we want to analyze what other factors that could affect unemployment. We specifically analyzed poverty, education, demographics. With our findings, we decided to exclude the year 2020 because it did not have the sufficient amount of information to analyze our data. The numbers would have been skewed and incorrect, thus impacting the rest of our data analysis.
